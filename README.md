# crud-exercise
A bare bones CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web application built using C#/ASP.NET Core.

## Goal
This web application is a cruise line passenger management tool and should:

1. Store passenger number, first name, last name, and phone number
	 
2. Generate unique passenger numbers using a strategy of your choosing
	 
3. Allow users to create new passengers including first name, last name, and phone number; the passenger number should be auto-generated when saving the record
	 
4. Allow users to update passengers including the three user-chosen values
	 
5. Allow users to delete a passenger
	 
6. Allow users to view a list of passengers
