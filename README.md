# crud-exercise-vscode
A bare bones CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web application built using C#/ASP.NET Core with VS Code.

NOTE: the Visual Studio Code approach to the project was abandoned in favor of one incorporating the benefits of Visual Studio 2017. The new project is located here: https://github.com/beandrake/crud-exercise
